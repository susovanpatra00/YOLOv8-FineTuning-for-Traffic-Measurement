# YOLOv8 FineTuning for Traffic Measurement

## Overview

This project leverages the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model to perform vehicle detection and traffic measurement. The primary objective is to accurately count and identify vehicles in images and videos to facilitate traffic analysis and management.


## Steps

### 1. Setup and Initialization

- **Objective**: Set up the environment and load the pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
- **Details**: Import required libraries and modules, load the YOLOv8 nano model from Ultralytics.

### 2. Image Inference

- **Objective**: Demonstrate vehicle detection on a sample image.
- **Details**: Perform inference on a sample image, annotate detected vehicles, and visualize the results.

### 3. Dataset Analysis

- **Objective**: Analyze the dataset to ensure image consistency and count.
- **Details**: Count the number of training and validation images, check for uniform image sizes.

### 4. Model Fine-Tuning

- **Objective**: Train the YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset for traffic measurement.
- **Details**: Fine-tune the model using specified training parameters such as epochs, batch size, and learning rate.

### 5. Model Validation

- **Objective**: Validate the model’s performance using a separate validation set.
- **Details**: Load the best model weights, validate on the validation set, and evaluate performance metrics.

### 6. Model Inference & Generalization Assessment

- **Objective**: Assess the model’s generalization capabilities.
- **Details**: Perform inference on random validation images, unseen test images, and unseen test videos to ensure the model performs well in different scenarios.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of YOLOv8 for traffic measurement, focusing on vehicle detection and counting. It involves setting up the model, analyzing and fine-tuning the dataset, validating model performance, and assessing generalization capabilities.
